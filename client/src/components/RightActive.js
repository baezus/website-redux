      <p className="is-size-6 has-text-weight-bold is-size-7-mobile">Each packet's pink as bubblegum;<br/>
      the brand name's blue, in treble clef<br/>
      like champagne flutes and clarinets<br/>
      or running faucets, grinning glass.<br/>
       <br/>
      False and guilt free, acid sweet<br/>
      we want it sample size, and clean<br/>
      as mirrors swept with Spic'n Span. <br/>
      It simulates our love like sleep. <br/>
      <br/>
      Truer sweet is six feet down, <br/>
      where subway adumbrations grip <br/>
      my sneaker soles slicked by wind <br/>
      of hurricanes far south of town. <br/>
      <br/>
      My father dozes on the A <br/>
      half ghost and dreaming he can be <br/>
      an architect, his labor seen <br/>
      in pyramids of saccharin. <br/>
